I had a difficulty with my images because of the new update. I fixed this by toggling "estimated size" in the collection view flow layout, to "none".

### Notes
I had some difficulties after I added the AlamofireImage Pod into the flixter folder because I kept getting errors saying that it didn't recognize the Pod. I cleaned the Build Folder and Buit the app again in order to fix this issue.
